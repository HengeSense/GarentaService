/**
 * CC3Shader represents an OpenGL shader, compiled from GLSL source code. 
 *
 * CC3Shader is an abstract class. You should instantiate one of the concrete classes:
 * CC3VertexShader or CC3FragmentShader.
 *
 * In most cases, you will create an instance of one of these subclasses by loading and
 * compiling GLSL code from a file using the shaderFromSourceCodeFile: method.
 *
 * Since a single shader can be used by more than one shader program, shaders are cached.
 * The application can use the class-side getShaderNamed: method to retrieve a compiled shader
 * from the cache, and the class-side addShader: method to add a new shader to the cache.
 * The shaderFromSourceCodeFile: method automatically retrieves existing instances from the
 * cache and adds any new instances to the cache.
 *
 * See the notes of the methods described above for more details.
